# Command-Manual-Generation-System

This repository contains a Python program that implements a command manual generation system. The project handles documentation for 20 selected commands, with the following main functionalities:

## Key Features

1. **Command Manual Generation**: 
   - Generates an XML file (`Commands.xml`) containing manuals for 20 predefined Linux commands.
   
2. **Command Manual Verification**:
   - Verifies the integrity of the generated manuals by checking if they change after a specific time period.
   
3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Allows users to search for any command and view detailed information about it.

4. **Command Suggestion (Recommendation)**:
   - Recommends related commands based on similar functionality or name.

## Commands Covered

- `ls` – List directory contents
- `touch` – Create an empty file or update a file’s timestamp
- `mv` – Move or rename files and directories
- `rm` – Remove files or directories
- `cat` – Concatenate and display file content
- `head` – Display the first few lines of a file
- `tail` – Display the last few lines of a file
- `more` – View file content one screen at a time
- `less` – View file content with backward and forward navigation
- `wc` – Word, line, and byte count of a file
- `rev` – Reverse the content of lines
- `which` – Locate the executable path of a command
- `factor` – Display the prime factors of a number
- `seq` – Generate sequences of numbers
- `uniq` – Filter out repeated lines in a file
- `logname` – Print the current user’s login name
- `pwd` – Print the current working directory
- `who` – Show who is logged on the system
- `date` – Display or set the system date and time
- `ps` – Report the current processes running on the system

## Important Notes

- **Command Manual Generation**: This operation requires the existence of the `commands.txt` file, which contains the names of the 20 predefined commands. Ensure that this file is properly generated before running the generation process.

- **Command Manual Verification**: This operation checks the integrity of the generated manuals by verifying the `Commands.xml` file, which holds the command manuals. Ensure to generate the command manuals first, as the verification process depends on the `Commands.xml` file being present and up to date.
